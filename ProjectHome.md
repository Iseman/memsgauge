**MEMSGauge** is a graphical frontend for the library libmemsinjection, which reads diagnostic data from the Rover MEMS 1.6 system via its diagnostic serial port. This will mostly be useful for those with a Mini SPi, which is fitted with MEMS 1.6 to control the single-point injection.

MEMSGauge depends on the [libmemsinjection](http://code.google.com/p/libmemsinjection) library, which in turn requires building a special cable to connect to the ECU's wiring harness. The wiki for libmemsinjection contains [information about how to build the hardware interface](http://code.google.com/p/libmemsinjection/wiki/HardwareInterface).
