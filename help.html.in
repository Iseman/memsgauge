    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>@PROJECTNAME@ is a software utility intended for diagnostics and testing of the Rover Modular Engine Management System (MEMS). Currently, it supports only MEMS 1.6, which is characterized by a round three-pin diagnostic plug typically found in the engine compartment near the firewall.</p>
    <p>Not all vehicles fitted with MEMS 1.6 use the same set of sensors and actuators. @PROJECTNAME@ was tested using a Mini SPi, so the features supported by the software are those that are used on that car. The feature set may be expanded in the future if other MEMS vehicle owners are able to discern further information about the diagnostic protocol.</p>
    <h3>Interface cable</h3>
    <p>To communicate with the MEMS ECU, @PROJECTNAME@ requires a special interface cable. Information on building a cable can be found here: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/libmemsinjection/wiki/HardwareInterface">https://code.google.com/p/libmemsinjection/wiki/HardwareInterface</a></p>
    <p>To summarize: the cable must be based on a USB 5V (TTL) serial converter. The FTDI TTL-232R-5V is recommended. The required connector shell is the TE Connectivity 172201. The shell must be populated with three pins, which are TE Connectivity 170280.</p>
    <p>Looking at the face of the connector with the key (notch) on the bottom, pin 1 will be on the top. Pin numbering continues clockwise. Pin 1 must be connected to the FTDI cable's GND (black) wire. Pin 2 is connected to the FTDI RxD (yellow), and pin 3 is connected to FTDI TxD (orange). The other FTDI wires are not used, and should be cut back and insulated.</p>
